- 👋 Hi, I’m @podruchnyj, a backend developer specializing in Python with a focus on Django, FastAPI, and python-telegram-bot. When I'm not coding, you can find me strumming my guitar or spending time with my cat, Archibald. I named him that because he's always curious and loves to explore new places, just like a little adventurer. He's such a mellow companion, and sometimes I affectionately call him Archi.

- 👀 I’m interested in building efficient backend systems, creating chatbots, and exploring new technologies to enhance user experiences.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about asynchronous programming in Python and diving deeper into data structures and algorithms to improve my problem-solving skills.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects that make a positive impact and challenge me to grow as a developer.

- 📫 How to reach me: Feel free to connect with me on GitHub or reach out via email at p0druchnyj@yandex.ru.

- 😄 Pronouns: He/him

- ⚡ Fun fact: I am passionate about mobile photography, I love traveling to cities and capturing cool shots, of course, Archie is the main model. He is always with me.
